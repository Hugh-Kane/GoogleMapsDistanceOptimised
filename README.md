# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
üåç‚ú® Explore Your Ideal Destination with Pinpoint Precision! üìçüöÄ

Introducing our cutting-edge Python-powered Google Maps API that goes beyond ordinary location searches. üåü Discover top-rated places tailored just for you, whether you're a foodie üçî, an adventurer üåÑ, or a culture connoisseur üèõÔ∏è.

Our simple API prioritizes proximity, ensuring you're never too far from your next adventure. ‚è≥ So for those who prefer to take it easy on foot, our API ensures you reach your destination with convenience and ease!



## Example <a name="example"></a>
As one can see, the first cafe listed when searching for cafes nearby the search area - Ark Hills Cafe appears. While this does seem like a nice cafe, it is a 20 minute walk away from the desired location. A similar observation can be made with the top 4 cafes which are recommended - they are too far.

With the updated Distance Optimised search, we can see that the top cafes suggested are significantly closer to the search location - requiring substantially less walking & effort to get to these. These cafes are, however, not in a random order & still prioritises rating - hence, providing meaningful cafe suggestions, within walking distance.

## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
This code utilises two types of API calls to Google Maps Services 
- [Geocoding request and response](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/requests-geocoding)
- [Nearby Search](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search-nearby)

In order for these API integrations to work, a Google Cloud project & API set-up is required. 
[More information can be found here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/cloud-setup)
